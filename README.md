### About SocialEyes
SocialEyes is a social media platform designed to encourage people to think about and discuss information they read. Whether it's a video, a news article, an instagram post, a research paper, or a podcast, SocialEyes gives people a platform to share their thoughts about the topic of their choice.    
             
### What makes SocialEyes different?</strong></h6>
SocialEyes is designed differently than most social media media. While most, such as Facebook or Twitter, encourage 
quantity, we enourage quality. We hope to achieve this with a number of features:

 - No comments! Unlike other social media sites, we want the discussions to happen offline. See an article and opinion you
 find interesting? Show it to your partner and chat about it! We hope this feature will encourage more conversation and reduce 'trolling' and 'keyboard warrior' type behaviour.
            
- Only your latest post will show on your followers feed. Make each post count!
        
- You must provide a link to the content you are discussing. Our aim is to add credibility to posts and allows other users to form opinions alongside yours!
